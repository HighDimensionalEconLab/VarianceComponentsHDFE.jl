- [Development Setup](develop.md)


This package estimates a two-way fixed effects model and computes its associated variance components using the methodology developed by Kline, Saggio and SÃ¸lvsten (KSS). We provide the usual Julia Package as well as an executable/app that can be run in the terminal. 

For instructions on how to install and use the executable follow this [link](https://highdimensionaleconlab.github.io/VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl/dev/Executable/).

For instructions on how to install the Julia Package and know about the exported methods follow this [link](https://highdimensionaleconlab.github.io/VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl/dev/Package/).
