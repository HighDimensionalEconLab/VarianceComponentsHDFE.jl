To do so, you will only be required to run an executable file (app) where the user only needs to input the original data (in .csv format) that contains a first identifier (e.g. worker id), a second identifier (e.g firm id) and outcome (e.g. log wage).","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"With the use of random projections techniques, it is possible to run leave out estimation of variance components on large datasets. To give an idea, for a dataset containing 5 million person year observations, 1.3 million person effects, 90 thousand firm effects the code takes approximately 20 minutes to compute the relevant leave out matrices on a HPC system with 32 cores assigned. For more information on this please refer to Appendix B in the main paper.

The user may choose to compute only a subset of these three components. Additionally, the executable will create a CSV file that stores vector of coefficients, the fixed effects for every observation in the leave-out connected set, as well as the diagonal matrices for P_iis and B_iis.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Use ","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"vchdfe --help","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"to see a complete list of available arguments:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"positional arguments:\n  path                  path to CSV file containing data\n\noptional arguments:\n  --first_id FIRST_ID   column index in CSV file for the first ID\n                        (e.g. Person).
