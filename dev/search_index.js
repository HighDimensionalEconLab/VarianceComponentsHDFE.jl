This is achieved by running an executable (app) in the terminal/powershell. The user needs to input to the app the path to the original data (in .csv format) and indicate the corresponding column in the .csv that contains the first identier (e.g. the worker id), the second identier (e.g the firm id) and the outcome (e.g. log wage). The link to the repository is this.","category":"page"},{"location":"#About-the-executable/app","page":"Home","title":"About the executable/app","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The algorithm prints the plug-in and the bias-corrected variance components estimators for the first identifier effects (e.g. variance of worker effects), the second identifier effects (e.g. variance of firm effects), and the covariance of both these effects (e.g. covariance of worker-firm effects). The user may choose to compute only a subset of these three components. Additionally, the executable will create a CSV file that stores the outcome variable, the first and second set of identifiers, and the estimated fixed effects for every observation that belongs to the leave-out connected set as defined in KSS. The algorithm also saves the statistical leverages, Pii, as well the weighting terms defined as Bii in KSS for a given variance component.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation-(Windows)","page":"Home","title":"Installation (Windows)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Open up a powershell terminal.

Add the installation directory to PATH. This will allow us to run the program everytime without specifying where the program is installed. To do so copy and paste the following line: \n\n ```\n setx PATH \"$env:path;$pwd\\vchdfe\\bin\" -m\n ```\n Note: This change will be permanent only if you ran powershell as administrator. Otherwise, everytime you need to run the program you need to specify the installation folder : we would have to type  `\"installation_path\"\\\\vchdfe\\\\bin\\\\vchdfe` instead of `vchdfe` everytime we want to run the program. \n\n5. (OPTIONAL) You can test the program using the sample test file provided with the executable:\n\n ```\n vchdfe vchdfe\\bin\\test.csv\n ```\n\n## Executable guide\n\nBefore this, make sure you've completed the installation steps shown above.

The first (that we refer to as Results) is a log file, in txt format, that writes a summary of the main results : bias-corrected components and some statistics from the leave-out sample. The second type of output (that we refer to as Detailed Output) is a DataFrame, stored in csv format, that saves important objects computed throughout the algorithm such a subset of the original data corresponding to the leave-out sample, the corresponding Pii and Bii, and the vector of coefficients used to compute the plug-in variance components. \n\nThe program provides two outputs: a file contains the main results and a detailed output file. \n\n### Results output\n\nBy using the argument `--write_results` followed by `--results_path MYFILE`, you can specify that you want to write the results in `MYFILE`. \n\n\n### Detailed output\n\nYou can save all the output details in a CSV file. You need to use `--write_detailed_CSV` followed by `--detailed_output_path MYFILE`, where `MYFILE` is the path to the detailed output file. \n\nThe detailed output file includes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n                           \n- `observation` : observation identifier in the original dataset that belong to the Leave-out connected set. For instance, if the number 3 appears in this vector, it means that the third observation in the original dataset belongs to the leave-out connected set. \n- `first_id`: the first identifier corresponding to each observation in `obs` (e.g. worked ids in the leave-out connected set).\n- `second_id`: the second identifier corresponding to each observation in `obs` (e.g. firm ids in the leave-out connected set).\n- `beta`: the vector of coefficients used to compute the plug-in variance components.\n- `D_alpha`: the fixed effect for the first identifier corresponding to each observation. \n- `F_psi`: the fixed effect for the second identifier corresponding to each observation. \n- `Pii`: statistical leverage corresponding to each observation in `obs`.\n- `Bii_first`: The Bii for the variance of `first_id` effects corresponding to each observation in `obs`.\n- `Bii_second`: The Bii for the variance of `second_id` effects corresponding to each observation in `obs`.\n- `Bii_cov`: The Bii for the co-variance of `first_id` and `second_id` effects corresponding to each observation in `obs`.\n\n## Examples \n\nSuppose we have a dataset `my_data.csv` that is stored in `\"C:\\\\Users\\\\owner\\\\Desktop\\\\vchdfe\\\\\"`. The structure of the data is such that the fifth column corresponds to the worker identifier and the third column corresponds to the firm identifier. Moreover, we want to store a summary of the results in this location `\"C:\\\\Users\\\\owner\\\\Desktop\\\\vchdfe\\\\summary.txt\"`, and the detailed output (Pii and Bii matrices, stored fixed effects, etc.) here  `\"C:\\\\Users\\\\owner\\\\Desktop\\\\vchdfe\\\\output.csv\"`. \n\n\n1.
