# VarianceComponentsHDFE

This package estimates a two-way fixed effects model and computes its associated variance components using the methodology developed by Kline, Saggio and SÃ¸lvsten (KSS). We provide the usual Julia Package as well as an executable/app that can be run in the terminal. For more details about this please see the corresponding Executable section. The link to the repository can be found  [here](https://github.com/HighDimensionalEconLab/VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl).
