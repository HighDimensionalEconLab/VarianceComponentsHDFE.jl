# VarianceComponentsHDFE

This package runs Kline, Saggio and SÃ¸lvsten (KSS) bias correction of variance components in two-way fixed effects models. This is achieved by running an executable (app) where the user only needs to input the original data (in .csv format) that contains a first identier (e.g. worker id), a
second identier (e.g firm id) and outcome (e.g. log wage). The link to the repository is [this]( https://github.com/HighDimensionalEconLab/VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl).


## About the executable/app

The algorithm prints the plug-in and the bias-corrected variance components estimators for the first identifier effects (e.g. variance of worker effects), the second identifier effects (e.g. variance of firm effects), and the covariance of both these effects (e.g. covariance of worker-firm effects). The user may choose to compute only a subset of these three components. Additionally, the executable will create a CSV file that stores outcome, ids, and the fixed effects for every observation belonging to the leave-out connected set as defined in KSS. The algorithm also saves the statistical leverages, Pii, as well the weighting terms defined as Bii in KSS.

## Installation (Windows)

1. Open up a powershell terminal (Windows + R, then type "powershell"), and press Enter.

2. Change the current directory by typing `cd "your_desired_path"`. 

 Hint : To copy-paste into the terminal use the standard Ctrl+C and paste into the powershell by using right click.

3. In the powershell, install the latest version:

```
wget https://github.com/HighDimensionalEconLab/VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl/releases/download/v0.1.5/vchdfe--windows-latest.tar.gz -O vchdfe-windows-latest.tar.gz
 
tar -xvf vchdfe-windows-latest.tar.gz
```

 Note that to be able to use wget on Windows Internet Explorer should have been launched at least once. 

4. (OPTIONAL): Add the current directory to PATH:

```
setx PATH "$env:path;$pwd\vchdfe\bin" -m
```
Note: To permanently change the path, you need to run powershell as adminstrator. 

5. Test using the sample test file:

```
vchdfe vchdfe\bin\test.csv
```

A detailed list of the output is provided below.
                      
                           
- `obs` : observation identifier in the original dataset that belong to the Leave-out connected set. For instance, if the number 3 appears in this vector, it means that the third observation in the original dataset belongs to the leave-out connected set. 
- `first_id`: the first identifier corresponding to each observation in `obs` (e.g. worked ids in the leave-out connected set).
- `second_id`: the second identifier corresponding to each observation in `obs` (e.g. firm ids in the leave-out connected set).
- `beta`: the vector of coefficients
- `D_alpha`: the fixed effect for the first identifier corresponding to each observation. We can obtain the plug-in estimator of the variance component of this effect by computing the variance of this vector.
- `F_psi`: the fixed effect for the second identifier corresponding to each observation. We can obtain the plug-in estimator of the variance component of this effect by computing the variance of this vector.
- `Pii`: statistical leverage corresponding to each observation in `obs`.
- `Bii_first`: The Bii to correct the variance of `first_id` effects corresponding to each observation in `obs`.
- `Bii_second`: The Bii to correct the variance of `second_id` effects corresponding to each observation in `obs`.
- `Bii_cov`: The Bii to correct the co-variance of `first_id` and `second_id` effects corresponding to each observation in `obs`.

## About the current version


- The bias-correction currently only runs on a model without controls.
- If the user wants, they can manually preadjust on her own the outcome. For instance, in an AKM context, the user can run first
    $$y = pe + fe + Xb + e$$ , where $$pe$$ are person effects and $$fe$$ are firm effects, and feed into the routine $$y-Xb$$ as the outcome.
